# streamlined ebook download from lib genesis
This is a ebook download script. 
## How to use this script
1. Copy the book name (full name is not ruquired, but at least a proper name.) 
2. Start the script
3. It will download the two latest versions of the book in two formats: epub and pdf. (From lib genesis)

I often download books from this website, which contains a lot of non-friction books. As a result, this script might not be very good for non-fictions.
